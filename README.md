# CryptoCrafter
This repository contains Python implementations for various cryptography Methods:

1. **Encoding and Decoding Text to Number**: Converts text to a number representation, saves it to a file, and retrieves it back to text form.
2. **Caesar Encryption and Decryption**: Implements the Caesar cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text.
3. **Exponential (Diffie-Hellman) Encryption and Decryption**: Implements exponential encryption and decryption using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- See `requirements.txt` for package dependencies.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
